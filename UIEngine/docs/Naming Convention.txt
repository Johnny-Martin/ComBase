Naming Convention

=======================Part One: resource picture id===========================================================
There are four base types of resource picture: image목texture목imagelist and texturelist.
And for texture, there're three subdivision types: ThreeH목ThreeV and Nine
see the sample file in folder "docs"


image and  texture's id must have two sections: type section and identifier section
for example:
	image.cancleBtnBkg (the corresponding png file must be "image.cancleBtnBkg.png")
        texture.MinBtnBkg  (the corresponding png file must be "texture.MinBtnBkg.png")

imagelist's id must have two sections: list type section 목and identifier section
and texturelist's id must have three sections: list type section 목picture type section and identifier section
for example:
	texturelist.Nine.btnbkg  (the corresponding png file must be "texturelist.Nine.btnbkg.png")
	texturelist.ThreeV.btnbkg(the corresponding png file must be "texturelist.ThreeV.btnbkg.png")
        imagelist.downArrow      (the corresponding png file must be "imagelist.downArrow.png")

====================================Part Two: Font id===========================================================
a full id of font should looks like that:

Arial.12.thin.0.1.1

facename.height.weight.underline.italic.strickout

we can define a font only use "facename.height", other attributes will be set with default value:

attribute              default value
weight                  normal
underline               0
italic                  0
strickout               0

==================================Part Three: define Color=======================================================
you can define a color value in xml label <color></color>.
<color>#ff0523ff</color> (RGBA)  or  <color>#ff0523</color>(RGB)

and the following way is also allowed:
<color>255.5.35.255</color>(RGBA) or <color>255.5.35</color>(RGB)

if your code editor support "same words highligh",I recommend you use the first way, its easyer to find the places
using same color value.
